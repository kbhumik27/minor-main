The built assets will be in the `dist` folder and can be deployed to any static hosting provider.

## Notes

- This README previously contained references to an external service; those references have been removed.
- If you removed a dev tool or CLI from `devDependencies`, run `npm install` to update `package-lock.json` or run `npm uninstall <pkg>` to remove it from the lockfile as well.
